## Navigation

Blind individuals can navigate websites using keyboard shortcuts and commands, which are typically supported by most modern web browsers. Here are some common keyboard navigation techniques:

1. **Tab navigation**: Pressing the Tab key allows users to navigate through interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) on a web page. Shift + Tab allows them to navigate in reverse order.

2. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Many screen readers have keyboard shortcuts for various navigation tasks. For example, in NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), a popular screen reader for Windows, users can navigate by headings using the H key.

3. **Access keys**: Some websites provide access keys to allow users to jump directly to specific sections or features. These are usually activated by pressing a combination of keys (often Alt + a letter or number).

4. **Skip links**: Skip links are hidden links at the top of the page that allow users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to the main content. They are helpful for users who rely on screen readers.

5. **Landmarks and headings**: Screen readers can navigate through landmarks (such as navigation, main content, and footer) and headings to provide a structural overview of the page. Users can jump directly to a specific landmark or heading to quickly find relevant content.

6. **Forms and interactive elements**: Screen readers provide users with information about interactive elements, such as form fields and buttons, allowing them to navigate and interact with these elements using keyboard commands.

By ensuring proper keyboard accessibility and following web standards for navigation and focus management, web developers can make their sites more usable for blind individuals and others who rely on keyboard navigation.
